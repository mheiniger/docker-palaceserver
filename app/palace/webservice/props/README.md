This is the place where the props webservice should be placed.

In the original its the folders "get", "new" and "upload".

That script is not open-source and owned by https://www.elitepalaces.com 

We are working on an alternative solution, but the time being you need to get/buy it from them and place it in run/webservice/props after you started up the server the first time.
